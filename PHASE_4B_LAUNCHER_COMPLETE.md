## ðŸ“Š Technical Architecture

### **Components Enhanced**

1. **LauncherDashboard.tsx** - Main monitoring interface with real-time updates
2. **ProcessMonitor.ts** - Core process monitoring engine
3. **GameLauncher.ts** - Enhanced with health summary methods
4. **Monitor API Routes** - Complete CRUD operations for process management

### **Real-time Features**

- Socket.io integration for live updates
- Auto-refresh functionality with user controls
- Real-time process metrics streaming
- Live connection status monitoring
- Instant alert handling for crashes/issues

### **Advanced Metrics Display**

- Process information (Game ID, User ID, Start Time, Responsiveness)
- Stability metrics (Crash Count, Restart Count, Last Check)
- System information (Working Directory, Command Line)
- Resource usage (CPU percentage, Memory in GB, Uptime)
- Health distribution analytics across all processes

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Options

### **Dashboard Controls**

- **Auto-refresh Toggle**: Enable/disable automatic data updates
- **Refresh Intervals**: 2, 5, 10, 30 second options
- **Advanced Metrics**: Show/hide detailed process information
- **Session Expansion**: Collapse/expand individual session details

### **Health Indicators**

- **Healthy (80-100)**: Green indicators, optimal performance
- **Warning (60-79)**: Yellow indicators, potential issues
- **Critical (<60)**: Red indicators, immediate attention needed
