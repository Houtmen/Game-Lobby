- **Chat message broadcasting** (text and system messages)
- **Host transfer logic** when host leaves
- **Session status updates** (waiting, starting, in-progress)

### 2. Modern Lobby Interface (`src/components/lobby/LobbyInterface.tsx`)

- **Client-side connection management** with auto-reconnection
- **Event-driven architecture** for real-time updates

### 4. Database Integration
- **Game sessions** with host and player relationships
- **Chat message persistence** with user attribution
- **Sample game data** seeded for demonstration

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### WebSocket Events
- `join_lobby` / `leave_lobby` - Lobby management
- `join_session` / `leave_session` - Room management

### Real-time Features
- **Player join/leave notifications**
- **Ready state synchronization**
- **Host privilege management**
- **System message broadcasting**
- **Chat message delivery**

### Data Flow
```
Client → Socket.io → Server Authentication → Database → Broadcast → All Clients
```
